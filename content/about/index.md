Welcome to my blog! ✨ My name is Egor, and I'm thrilled to have you here. As a software engineer, I love sharing my insights on all things tech-related. But that's not all! I also dive into topics like media and popular culture, giving you a well-rounded perspective on the world we live in 🌐.

Whether you're a seasoned tech guru or just dipping your toes into the world of IT, my blog has something for everyone. Join the conversation by subscribing to my social media channels 📱 (links above) or by following my RSS 📢 feed (link above). And don't be shy - leave your comments and thoughts on any post that catches your eye. After all, this blog is for you! 💙

By the way, I write my posts both in English and Russian, so feel free to choose the language most comfortable for you. It's English by default, but you can find a link to all posts in Russian in the menu above.
